    Bad Example
</h1>
<h2>
    <br>
        <div>When you check out windows93.net, it feels like you've time-traveled back to the '90s! Everything looks so old-school, like you're using a computer from way back when. There aren't any words or info, just a bunch of pictures, and the background color really stands out, making it feel even more retro. </div>
    </br>

<h2>
    <br>
        <div>When you visit spacejam.com, it feels like you're stepping back in time. The homepage looks kinda old-fashioned, and the colors are a bit too flashy, which can be distracting. Plus, there's not much cool stuff like videos or pictures to grab your attention, which you'd expect from a movie website.</div>

    <br>
        <div>When you check out art.yale.edu, it's a bit all over the place. The background colors don't really match, and the text is kinda scattered around awkwardly. Plus, it doesn't feel very official or polished since there's no clear branding or professional vibe to the design. </div>
