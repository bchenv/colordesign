<h1>Good Example</h1>

<h2>
    <br>
    <div>The Eleven Plants for Dum-Dums and Cool People website uses a bunch of different shades of green and some brown colors on a light cream background. Green is cool because it reminds people of nature and being outdoors, which is great if you're selling natural stuff. Brown is often used with green for things like food and farming, making it feel natural and organic. So, these colors together give off a chill vibe and make the website feel connected to nature and all that good stuff.</div>
